# Code Changes Summary

## Files Modified

### Backend Changes

#### 1. `backend/app.py`
**Changes:**
- Removed `import base64` (no longer needed)
- Updated `create_talk()` function:
  - Changed authentication from Basic to Bearer token: `f"Bearer {D_ID_API_KEY}"`
  - Added voice provider configuration:
    ```python
    "provider": {
        "type": "microsoft",
        "voice_id": "en-US-JennyNeural"
    }
    ```
  - Updated config parameters:
    ```python
    "config": {
        "fluent": "false",
        "pad_audio": "0.0",
        "stitch": True
    }
    ```

**Why:** D-ID API requires Bearer token authentication, not Basic auth. The additional configuration ensures better video quality and proper voice synthesis.

### Frontend Changes

#### 2. `frontend/src/componentes/api/make_mirror.jsx`
**Changes:**
- Added environment variable import: `const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL || "http://127.0.0.1:5000";`
- Completely rewrote the function to send FormData:
  ```javascript
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('image', imageFile);
  formData.append('text', text);
  
  const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/talk`, {
      method: "POST",
      body: formData, // Send as FormData, not JSON
  });
  ```
- Removed incorrect JSON.stringify() and Content-Type header
- Added proper error throwing

**Why:** Files must be sent as FormData multipart/form-data, not JSON. The backend expects this format to properly receive and save the uploaded image.

---

#### 3. `frontend/src/componentes/api/replies.jsx`
**Changes:**
- Updated API_BASE_URL to use environment variable:
  ```javascript
  const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL || "http://127.0.0.1:5000";
  ```

**Why:** Consistent environment variable usage and Vite compatibility.

---

#### 4. `frontend/src/componentes/pages/mirror.jsx`
**Major refactor with multiple changes:**

**New State Variables:**
```javascript
const [imagePreview, setImagePreview] = useState(null);
const [videoUrl, setVideoUrl] = useState(null);
const [isGeneratingVideo, setIsGeneratingVideo] = useState(false);
```

**Updated `handleImage()` function:**
```javascript
const handleImage = (e) => {
  const file = e.target.files?.[0];
  if (file) {
    setImageFile(file);
    // Create a preview URL for the uploaded image
    const previewUrl = URL.createObjectURL(file);
    setImagePreview(previewUrl);
    addMessage("Face uploaded. The mirror is watching.", "ai");
  }
};
```

**New cleanup effect:**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    if (imagePreview) {
      URL.revokeObjectURL(imagePreview);
    }
  };
}, [imagePreview]);
```

**Completely rewrote `handleSubmit()` function:**
- Added inline `handleVideoGeneration` callback function
- Proper video generation flow with loading states
- Sets `videoUrl` from API response
- Better error handling and user feedback

**Updated Video Panel JSX:**
- Shows loading state during video generation
- Displays generated video with controls when available
- Shows image preview when image uploaded but no video yet
- Fallback to loader when nothing uploaded

**Why:** 
- Image persistence: File and preview URL stored in state
- Better UX: Users see their uploaded image immediately
- Proper video handling: Generated videos are displayed correctly
- Memory management: Cleanup prevents memory leaks from object URLs

---

### Configuration Changes

#### 5. `frontend/.env`
**Changes:**
- Changed `API_BASE_URL` to `VITE_API_BASE_URL`

**Why:** Vite requires the `VITE_` prefix for environment variables to be accessible in the browser.

---

### New Files Created

#### 6. `backend/.env.example`
**Purpose:** Template for backend environment variables with instructions.

#### 7. `frontend/.env.example`
**Purpose:** Template for frontend environment variables.

#### 8. `backend/test_setup.py`
**Purpose:** Automated test script to verify:
- Environment variables are set
- D-ID API connectivity and credits
- Uploads folder exists and is writable
- BASE_URL configuration (warns about localhost)

#### 9. `FIXES_AND_SETUP.md`
**Purpose:** Comprehensive documentation covering:
- All issues that were fixed
- How the system works now
- Complete setup instructions
- D-ID API documentation
- Testing checklist
- Common issues and solutions
- Architecture overview

## Key Concepts

### Image Upload Flow (Before Fix)
```
User uploads → imageFile stored → mirro_function called
                                  ↓
                          ❌ JSON.stringify(image) - WRONG
                                  ↓
                          Backend receives nothing useful
```

### Image Upload Flow (After Fix)
```
User uploads → imageFile stored → Create preview URL
                                  ↓
                          mirro_function called with File object
                                  ↓
                          FormData with actual file
                                  ↓
                          Backend saves to static/uploads/
                                  ↓
                          Creates public URL
                                  ↓
                          D-ID API receives image URL
                                  ↓
                          Video generated and returned
                                  ↓
                          Frontend displays video
```

### D-ID Authentication (Before Fix)
```python
auth_header = "Basic " + base64.b64encode(D_ID_API_KEY.encode()).decode()
# ❌ Wrong - D-ID doesn't use Basic auth
```

### D-ID Authentication (After Fix)
```python
headers = {
    "authorization": f"Bearer {D_ID_API_KEY}"
}
# ✅ Correct - D-ID uses Bearer token
```

## Testing the Fixes

### Quick Test Sequence:

1. **Run Backend Test:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python test_setup.py
   ```
   Should show all green checkmarks.

2. **Start Backend:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Start Frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Manual Test:**
   - Navigate to `/mirror`
   - Upload an image (should see preview immediately)
   - Send a few chat messages
   - After threshold, video generation should trigger
   - Watch for "Generating your reflection..." message
   - Video should appear and play automatically

### Expected Console Logs:

**Backend:**
```
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
[Incoming request to /talk]
[File saved to: static/uploads/uuid_filename.jpg]
[D-ID API called with source_url: https://...]
[Talk ID: xxx]
[Status: created]
[Status: processing]
[Status: done]
[Returning video_url: https://...]
```

**Frontend:**
```
[Image uploaded successfully]
[Calling /talk endpoint]
[Received video URL: https://...]
```

## Critical Points for Production

1. **ngrok is Required for Local Development**
   - D-ID needs public URL to access images
   - `BASE_URL` must be ngrok URL, not localhost

2. **CORS is Enabled**
   - `CORS(app)` allows frontend to call backend
   - In production, restrict to specific origins

3. **File Storage**
   - Currently saves to local `static/uploads/`
   - For production, use cloud storage (S3, etc.)
   - Update `source_url` generation accordingly

4. **API Keys Security**
   - Never commit `.env` files
   - Use `.env.example` as template
   - Rotate keys if accidentally exposed

5. **Video URL Expiration**
   - D-ID video URLs expire after ~24 hours
   - Store videos permanently if needed
   - Download and save to your own storage

## Maintenance Notes

### If D-ID API Changes:
- Check documentation at https://docs.d-id.com
- Update `create_talk()` function payload
- Test with `test_setup.py`

### If Adding New Features:
- Image editing before upload → Modify `handleImage()`
- Multiple images → Add array state and carousel
- Custom voices → Update provider config in backend
- Longer videos → Adjust polling timeout (currently 60s)

### Common Customizations:
- **Change AI Voice:** Modify `voice_id` in `app.py` (see D-ID docs for options)
- **Adjust Video Quality:** Add `"result_format"` in config
- **Change Insanity Threshold:** Edit `insanityThreshold` calculation in `replies.jsx`
- **Custom Video Size:** Add `"driver_expressions"` config in payload
